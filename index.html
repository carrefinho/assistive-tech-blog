                    <h2>guilty as charged</h2>
                </div>        
                <div class="content-body">
                    <p>The article was quite an interesting read, as I haven&#39;t touched Tik Tok for quite some time after creating an account for some reason, and it does shed some light on how it hooks people. </p>
                    <p>I think the minimizing of friction is really something the developers&#39; have polished to an extreme extent, or in other words, shoving the &quot;content&quot; right into users&#39; faces(which I find extraordinarily annoying, especially when it takes over the music I have playing in the background whenever I open the app). The way content is displayed fits the content format perfectly(as in vertical video, a cardinal sin) where the device&#39;s display has no wasted space and they don&#39;t add any extra steps like having to manually start playing or unmuting. The infinite scroll isn&#39;t a new idea but, by displaying only one piece of the content, the &quot;surprise mechanic&quot; as mentioned in the article is really in play here(again I find it quite obnoxious, but that&#39;s probably due to me just not viewing much stuff and interacting so that the algorithm has no idea what I like so I ended up with a feed of just whatever is trending), which provokes the user&#39;s curiosity to keep on scrolling.   </p>
                    <p>I&#39;m quite torn on the idea of built in behavior management mechanisms built into these apps because, given that Tik Tok is pretty much built upon their method of delivering content(a large portion of which is of &quot;discover&quot; type) and changing that in any meaningful way would probably be detrimental to the overall experience, like say, the user scrolls upwards, and boom, there&#39;s nothing left. If the users could have access to their &quot;profile&quot; in the eye of the algorithm and make modifications should they desire, that would probably be effective in controlling the scope of content intake and thus limit the amount of infinite scrolling from happening, but again, giving users this level of access seems unlikely, and it&#39;ll still require some level of self control for it to be effective. A system level limitation on screen time, similar to what is already present with iOS, is, in my opinion, the simplest and most effective restrictive method, since there are no changes to the consumption process but a straightforward time limit.</p>
                    <p>Reflecting upon my daily routings, I probably spend too much time on YouTube, because I have a weird habit of listening to some vocal content when working. It&#39;s usually news podcasts, and, very frequently, a particular PC hardware YouTuber who rambles too much and makes videos of upwards of one hour about very simple subjects. These usually serve as background noise whenever I do stuff unrelated to text(in which case it gets distracting), housework or random errands, and I do still process the content in my brain albeit at a very surface level. Here some of the usual techniques still definitely apply; I usually stick with one YouTuber and binge their longer content pieces, as to who gets to be that lucky one is largely decided by whatever the algorithm decides to show on my home page on that day. And auto play doesn&#39;t help either. </p>

                    <h1>WEEK 5</h1>
                    <h2>next billion ads</h2>
                </div>        
                <div class="content-body">
                    <p>Again (almost as usual at this point), I&#39;m having really ambivalent feelings towards this &quot;Next Billion Users&quot; thing at Google. I&#39;m going to sound really cynical...... Please bear with me.</p>
                    <p>I understand and agree with most of the points that Asif Baki brought up. In particular, I have no doubts that with a company the size and scope of Google, such an initiative to broaden their focus and provide more relevant and accessible service to more parts of the world, would definitely help in the distribution of information as he stated. He brought up Google Files, an exemplar of the project. I looked it up and it is apparently very popular indeed on the Google Play Store. </p>
                    <p>However, as I went through the feature list of the Files app, I was suddenly and painfully reminded of my experience as an Android smartphone user from years past. Google Files is not new, at all. Apps like this(usually branded as system cleaning/performance-enhancing) have existed since practically the birth of the Android operating system. Android&#39;s open approach to file management, loose control over permissions, and unregulated app installations lead to significant performance degradation over short periods of usage, especially on lower-end devices, where the limited storage and memory only added fuel to the flame. Even though Google Files isn&#39;t a particularly new concept in itself, I can at least appreciate the effort, clean interface, not bundling malware(like its counterparts usually do; Files is debatable) and have some faith in Google&#39;s knowledge in their own operating system. But still, why can&#39;t they fix Android in the first place?</p>
                    <p>Google is pretty notorious for its <a href='https://killedbygoogle.com/'>infamous graveyard of killed projects</a>. I assume that, with the sheer size of their operations, teams are pretty much throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks(most don&#39;t), and apparently upper management is quite fond of this scraping-stuff-off-the-wall game. With this in mind, I actually feel like Next Billion Users could be helpful in that regard for them to tidy up their product development process(and maybe actually do research before releasing stuff).</p>
                    <p>At the same time, my trust issues with Google still surround me as I listened to the podcast. Google&#39;s main source of revenue is advertisement; and the next billion users are the next billion potential customers(or as some might prefer to put it: the products). The most privacy-conscious are trying everything to remove Google from their lives, and yet we seem to have no option but relying this much on mega-corporations to push the access of internet and information in less-developed regions. The privacy issues of Google and co have long been comprehensively documented, and yet, even among those relatively tech-literate(like us), we either have no option but to willfully neglect the risks or are simply not aware of them. Let alone those who maybe just gotten their hands on their first smartphone: the invasion of privacy will surely be swept under the radar. There is no substantial opposing force against targeted advertising(except maybe GDPR), and there won&#39;t be one either among the next billion users.</p>
                    <p>This is where, I&#39;m again reminded of what I&#39;ve been thinking about since the beginning of the class: how often is product and UX design, in these contexts, set up to &quot;educate&quot; the user rather than being designed around them? I&#39;m clearly aware of the manipulative and addiction inducing mechanics all over the internet, and there are indubitably people behind them. It&#39;s just that we&#39;ll probably never get to know what happened behind the curtains, behind the sunshine and rainbow of how they&#39;re addressing &quot;the needs of people living in rapidly growing global communities&quot;.</p>
                    <p>This podcast definitely reminded me of one thing though: I&#39;ve been holding off getting rid of Google Chrome for too long. I made the move to <a href='https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium'>ungoogled-chromium</a> before writing this and, well, it&#39;s not bad for now.</p>

                    <h1>WEEK 4</h1>
                    <h2>thousand faces</h2>
                </div>        
                <div class="content-body">
                    <p>The article outlined a couple of interesting things in Spotify&#39;s process of designing their personas and quite effectively presented the reason behind their need for said personas given that Spotify is a product with, understandably, extremely diverse user groups and personalized features that demand a level of understanding of such users.</p>
                    <p>The &quot;failed&quot; Phase 1 from 2017 is rather intriguing in that, contrary to my instincts, they found that the actual behaviors(as in attitude, value judgement, and usage of devices) are more effective as the incentive for listening to music is consistent across users. This does make sense upon further consideration, but since they didn&#39;t really disclose much detail in the reasoning process, I can&#39;t really figure out much more either. But I do believe their approach is effective in their attention on users&#39; usage of devices, which presumably resulted in the Spotify Connect feature. This concept of Spotify Connect is quite simple, to allow devices to control each other&#39;s playback, but it does provide a ton of convenience in the modern day where almost everything can run Spotify and the abundance of smart speakers in homes.</p>
                    <p>As to Phase 2, I was beginning to get a little confused when they started bringing up corporate jargon like <strong>Listening Together Framework™</strong>, and, to my great disappointment, not actually sharing anything about the personas aside from the illustrations. I do agree with the usage of color and illustrations to represent these fictional users(and user groups they belong to) in that I too find usage of stock photos or photos of random people in personas oddly disturbing. The crafted personality and behavior, in combination with the photograph, creates an eerily disturbing mixture of reality and &quot;engineered&quot; fiction.</p>

                    <h3>Just Enough Research by Erika Hall</h3>
                    <p>I have to say I went into the talk with a bit ambivalence, given my reluctance to conduct any kind of research in almost everything I do and the frustrating inability to change that(while also somehow taking pride in that), but it was quite refreshing see a few new perspectives on the topic of research. Admittedly, Erika Hall&#39;s dressing for the job you want approach and sometimes whacky slides did help the presentation but I digress.</p>
                    <p>The Segway example is really compelling as something that was built upon a distorted premise. Apparently Segway, as in the two-wheeled self-balancing vehicle, had been discontinued by June 2020. Erika Hall talked about how the Segway only manages to cater to a very limited demographic and yet claims to change the world of personal transportation, and this got me thinking, was the premise of Segway really to change the world or just a buzzword for attracting money from investors and governments(who apparently have legitimate use cases)? One explanation I have is that, the people behind the project had become so firmly entrenched in the genuinely advanced technology that they&#39;d lost touch to a point where they perceived a $6,000 gadget could be the future. In that aspect I do agree with Hall&#39;s point but I&#39;m still not entirely sure.</p>
                    <p>On a broader level, one aspect that I found particularly helpful is the effect of research in the context of teamwork. Retrospectively, this could&#39;ve saved me(and my teammate) a lot of confusion and back and forth over ideas that seemed difficult to convey and exchange. Asking questions, working together to understand those questions and highlighting the problem does seem like a wonderful way to set the record straight and highly beneficial for efficient cooperation.</p>
                    <h3>Talking to Humans - The Story</h3>
                    <p>Not sure about how I should be &quot;reviewing&quot; a story; with that said the story of Koshi and Roberta is a rather thorough breakdown of how two &quot;scientists&quot; began to do research on their customers. Admittedly, them going from &quot;I’m a scientist, not a salesperson.&quot; to actually being able to talk to people in the turn of a day seems a bit far fetched but I get it that some creative freedom was needed here.</p>
                    <p>Some of the key things that I find more unexpected and arguably counterintuitive: don&#39;t take any statistics too literally and let any single number dominate the strategic thinking. I find this quite intriguing as it is, at least for me, human nature for find meanings in numbers that I&#39;ve collected and firmly believe in them, and it is probably indeed detrimental to grasping the bigger picture in the context of studying customers where the sample size could be inherently limited.</p>
                    <p>Where the duo discovered the actual pattern of purchasing pillows is also quite interesting: they set out targeting new graduates who need to outfit their apartments but ended up finding out that pillow purchases tend to align with significant life changes later in their lives. When reading their initial pitch, I did look at my own pillow, which I took from home with me, and unsurprisingly wasn&#39;t bought by myself. In fact I have no idea that I have no idea how to buy a pillow and I guess it is impossible for me to realize that without the story outlining how Koshi and Roberta did their research on buying pillows.</p>

                    <h1>WEEK 2</h1>
                    <h2>kids</h2>
                </div>        
                <div class="content-body">
                    <p>I got hooked 10 seconds into the talk when Paul Bennett kindly provided the crucial trivia that the &quot;Hello&quot; was in Bauer Bodoni and instantly gratified the typographically hysterical part of my brain. Overall I quite enjoyed this talk, and, as usual, still had a couple of problems and points of confusion to share.</p>
                    <p>The first two parts where Paul addresses the &quot;bleeding obvious&quot; and &quot;finding yourself in the margins&quot; make great points and, in my opinion, are somewhat intervened. They both present ways to think about the relationship between the designer and the user and putting ourselves into their shoes. </p>
                    <p>At the same time, I&#39;m not so sure about the example of the children&#39;s storage solution for IKEA presented in the third part. On the surface it&#39;s a clear and cut example of, as the title of the chapter suggests, having a beginner&#39;s mind. But then I thought about it from another perspective: would this be useful to me when I was a kid, when I, in Bennett&#39;s words, lived on, under, and around things? And the answer is maybe. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of stuffed animals but still had a couple that I really liked. The way I stored them was placing them on top of the sofa in the living room, which was situated against the wall and created a little bench suitable for a row of toys to sit on. Now you might be wondering, how does a five-year-old easily reach on top of a sofa? The truth is, for some reason, at the time I used to climb on top of and jump between the sofas almost too much, thus I had no problems making my way up and this was a very customized solution. </p>
                    <p>I was also really into model cars; especially larger 1:18 scale ones made of metal, with openable doors, hood/bonnet, working steering rack and suspension, et cetera. And how did I store them? Well, being scarily aware of their fragility after breaking a couple of wing mirrors off(and my naïve heart multiple times), I eventually resorted to a very adult-ish solution: in my father&#39;s bookshelf, specifically the lower levels. He&#39;s not going to touch them, and I don&#39;t run the risk of accidentally bumping them off or anything like that.</p>
                    <p>At this point I&#39;ve probably went too far with my childhood memories, but the point is: I&#39;m not very fond of this particular solution because it seems to reduce the target demographic into one very specific stereotype. Not all children are the same; not all live under and around things(some also on top of things), and not every kid needs a commercialized storage solution for their stuffed toys. This design, to me, feels like only scratching the surface of the mentality of a child, and attempts not to augment their existing &quot;scheme&quot; of using the space around but simply provides a complete answer to the problem(if there is one to begin with). It in a way contradicts with the previous chapter in that I think children should be encouraged to come up with their own solutions of storage, which could probably also be seen from a development perspective but that&#39;s story for another day. </p>
                    <p>Of course it&#39;s not meant for every kid, as in not any bookshelf is for everyone, but still, I&#39;m just not a fan of this design. Out of curiosity, I looked up &quot;IKEA children storage&quot; on Google, and the results are as follows.</p>
                    <p><a href="assets/image-20210210153654067.png"><img src="assets/image-20210210153654067.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="image-20210210153654067" width=100%></a></p>
                    <p>Apparently kids don&#39;t really mind shelves and bins.</p>

                <div class="content-body">
                    <p>I really enjoyed the podcast even though I do have problems with some parts of it. </p>
                    <p>The part involving the three-mile island incident and how feedback matters are both really intriguing ways to think about user-centric design. The latter made me think about my decision to purchase an Apple Watch recently to help with my pandemic-stricken lifestyle that has gotten increasingly sedentary. And it did help massively; the activity rings are an amazing means of feedback that encourages a more active lifestyle. In fact, the entire Activity/Fitness part of the Apple Watch is almost entirely comprised of different types of feedback to get the user up and moving more. Apart from the activity ring, there are awards, notifications, and competition with &quot;watch buddies&quot;, that make the shift towards a more active lifestyle rather fun, and arguably somewhat addictive. There could definitely be negative connotations to a system that creates an addictive feedback loop, but in this instance, for what its worth, it works well and doesn&#39;t necessarily have a &quot;malicious&quot; intent to it.</p>
                    <p>I think the most interesting part, and the part that I have most problems with(not necessarily a bad thing), is where the host and guests discuss planned obsolescence, or rather the fact that new and &quot;better&quot; products come out every year. There is a factual error in that they claim that iPhones are thinner every year when, in reality, they have gotten thicker from 2014 to 2019 with every major design revision. With that said, the question of, how is the new iPhone better, still applies. When I swapped out my totally smashed iPhone X from 2017 for a shiny new iPhone 12 Pro last year, my first impressions were, as expected, somehow underwhelming. The &quot;new&quot; boxy design(even though it is similar to iPhone 4 and 5s from the early 2010s) feels much worse in the hand. When I think about how a product get &quot;better&quot; iteratively every year, I could categorize changes into two types: design changes and technological advancements; and both types are subject to luring customers into the fallacy of &quot;new&quot;(and subsequently more advanced) is better. I would actually argue that Apple is pretty innocent in this aspect, and hereby I present my arch nemesis in mobile devices, and a example of (arguably) successfully selling a anti-user design in the name of it&#39;s &quot;new&quot;: curved screens. Look at almost every Samsung smartphone from the past 5 years or so and they all have screens curved outwards on both sides, but why? The curved display only came to fruition with the development of OLED displays that are flexible, and yet it doesn&#39;t improve the experience of the user in any meaningful way. In fact, far from it. Curved screens make swiping harder, creates distortion on the edges, are more prone to shattering, and ultimately, are more expensive which the customer is going to pay. This is something that I really don&#39;t understand over the years of following consumer electronics.</p>
