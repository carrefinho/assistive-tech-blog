                    <p>A contactless gesture switch with bi-directional detection, U-shaped frame designed with affordance in mind, and flexibility in usage and mounting options.</p>

                    <li><p>Week 3 - In-class ideation</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>After looking at all the abhorrently expensive AbleNet switches, we landed our focus on their selection of <a href='https://www.ablenetinc.com/switches/proximity-sensor-activation/'>proximity activated sensor switches</a> and decided to create our switch based on the same contactless principle.</li>
                    <li>Part of the reason was also the pertinence of a contactless switch amidst the current ongoing global pandemic where touching things aren’t really preferable.</li>
                    <li>We made a sketch and a cardboard prototype, which, retrospectively, has a surprising resemblance to the final product.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><p>Week 4 - Research</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><p>With the idea roughly settled down, we took a further look at the AbleNet solutions and found a couple of ways that we could potentially improve:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><p>10mm activation distance: given its nature as a “proximity” switch, the AbleNet Mini Beamer only triggers when an object is within 10 millimeters of its top surface. With some rudimentary conceptualization of how it works with a human hand, we think this wouldn’t be ideal if the aim is to avoid contact.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Placement: despite the compact form factor of the Mini Beamer, it’s design seemingly largely confines the device to sitting on top of a flat surface.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Price: it’s $145......</p>

                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Additionally we had a first look at sensor options:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Ultrasonic distance sensor(HC-SR04 and friends):</li>
                    <li>Infrared proximity sensor</li>
                    <li>Laser+Photodiode break-beam</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>It was also at this point, that we came up with the idea of an <em>deluxe</em> edition, with fancier materials, advanced visual/audio indication, and more functionalities on the software side. In the end we did manage to achieve most of these.</p>
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                    <li><p>Week 5 - Research II + Design I</p>
                    <p><img src="./images/image-20210512000147369.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="image-20210512000147369"></p>

                    <ul>
                    <li><p>As we gradually progressed into the actual design phase, we narrowed down on the hardware choices:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><p>Distance sensor: two RCWL-1601s</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>With a form factor similar to (admittedly slightly smaller) and software compatibility with the HC-SR04, and added bonus of natively supporting 3.3V microcontrollers, we ended up with this option also thanks to its affordability.</li>
                    <li>IR time-of-flight sensors are really cool and potentially more consistent in terms of data output for what we are trying to achieve here, but the cost is simply too much for a project of this scale.</li>
                    <li>Two of these are arranged horizontally so that we’d be able to differentiate the time difference between value changes to identify the direction of motion.</li>
                    
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Microcontroller:  Seeeduino XIAO</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>We’re not dealing with very complex code or massive amounts of IO, so a compact board will do the job nicely. The XIAO(fun fact, the name means 小, small in Chinese) is extremely compact, has a USB-C connector(unlike competitors with Micro-USB), plenty of IO pins, and is Arduino compatible.</li>
                    <li>It is also possible with power it with a Li-Ion battery but that remains part of the future plans.</li>
                    
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Visual Indicator: Adafruit Neopixel Stick</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>This is really just trying to have a bit of fun since two simple LEDs would suffice but where’s the charm in that?</li>
                    <li>8 WS2812b RGB LED modules means we can do some animations.</li>
                    
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Switching the 3.5mm jacks: NPN transistors</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>This part did not materialize, since we have no devices to test the 3.5mm jacks anyway. It should still be quite easy to implement.</li>
                    
                    </ul>

                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>It was also at this stage that we’ve decided to have two physical prototypes in parallel, representing two methods of fabrication and also exploring different aspects at the same time.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Aaron, located in Shanghai, utilizes the local IMA facilities to create his prototype with mainly acrylic. This way he could explore mounting, orientation, and form factor very easily. Although he doesn’t have the exact hardware outlined previously, the code is compatible with his Arduino UNO and HC-SR04s so we can work on the code at the same time. </li>
                    <li>Meanwhile I would cobble together my version of the switch with my own 3D-printer and hardware that more closely resembles the final product.</li>
                    
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>For mounting options, Robert did the majority of the research.  Since we still haven’t nailed down on the exact usage cases, and difficulty testing our prototype in real-life situations, mounting options stayed quite muddy.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>In the end we basically ripped off the Xbox Adaptive Controller and replicated its mounting holes: two 10-24 threaded holes compliant to the AMPS mounting pattern, and a single 1/4-20 threaded hole compatible with most tripods on the market.</li>
                    <li>It’s also worth noting that adhesives would work nicely with the large flat surfaces.</li>
                    
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    </ul>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Week 6 - Design II + Build!</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><p>With last week’s progress on laying out components and wiring up, we finalized our base and frame designs.</p>
                    <p><img src="./images/image-20210512001926502.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="image-20210512001926502"></p>

                    </li>
                    <li><p>My version ended up looking like this. It’s no longer one solid U-shaped piece since that would take forever to 3D-print. Instead, the structure is held up by the two spine pieces on both sides, fastened to the base and top parts with screws. Of course, screws are far from optimal, especially 12 of them for solely the main structure, but it’s the easiest for me to experiment with different materials and sizes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The <em>core module</em> housing all the electronics is attached via magnets to the main structure, and is removable/replaceable.</p>

                    <p>After our nerve-wrecking in-class live demo, I made a couple more changes to the hardware and software:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><p>As is quite apparent from the photos above, the 3D-printed translucent plastic spines are gone. Instead it’s now made of laser-cut 3mm thick brass.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><p>This has always been part of the plan, but unfortunately the package did not arrive on time on Friday.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The color looks amazing and it is indeed really sturdy, but.....</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>In many ways the brass spines are actually kind of worse than the plastic counterparts. They do not flex, like at all, which means it’s easier to knock the thing over and more likely to injure the user in the event of an collision.</li>
                    <li>They’re also incredibly heavy and shifts the center of gravity way towards the rear.</li>
                    
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>On the software side, I implemented the feature for the device to act as an USB HID device, meaning that it could simulate a USB input device like mice and keyboards.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>In the video below you could see the device inputting different words based on the direction.</li>
                    <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/548256805?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="at-progress-03"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
                    
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    </ul>
                    <h3 id='as-we-wave-hands'>As we wave hands...</h3>
                    <p>There are still a couple of issues and imperfections that remains unresolved:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><p>Mounting: This is one part that we have not successfully nailed down given the difficulty of testing.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Weight distribution</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>This involves a bit of dilemma: at the previous state with plastic spines, the weight distribution is not too bad, but considering the desktop use case, it’s still a little bit top heavy and quite prone to tipping over. However if we were to make the bottom part heavier, there might be implications with other orientations with the whole thing completely out of balance.</li>
                    
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Detection</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>At the moment, detection of the direction of motion is still largely unreliable. Contributing factors include the sensors with a large cone of detection, extremely simple code, and the simple fact that the two sensors are not really spaced out enough.</li>
                    <li>These issues could be ironed out with further development.</li>
                    
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Visual Indicator location</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>With the final prototype, the visual indicator is a strip down the bottom within the <em>core module</em>. This simplifies wiring but isn’t really a great location since it is often times covered by the hand moving above it and doesn’t not work well in the horizontal orientation either.</li>
                    <li>Ideally it would be located at the center, on the other side of the mounting holes, but running wires could be quite tricky.</li>
                    
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Integrated battery</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>With the option of using the device as an USB HID device, an integrated battery isn’t necessary at all, but with the potential 3.5mm jacks, this would be a nice addition.</li>
                    
                    </ul>
                    </li>

                    <p>I really enjoyed Crip Camp and it was very powerful at moments with the story of the campers and their fight beyond.</p>
                    <p>The rest of the readings got me thinking about the concept of spaces that we interact and fulfill our social and other tasks in, be it physical and virtual.</p>
                    <p>I’ve been learning web design recently and was surprised to the learn the almost staggering amount of accessibility features and standards specified by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAI-ARIA'>WAI-ARIA.</a> Then I tested a bunch of websites with a developer tool that runs automatic checks for accessibility issues, and was surprised(and unsurprised at the same time) to find out that two-digits of issues is seemingly the norm for even established sites with ginormous traffic. In the end I had to remind myself that not even that many websites are “functional” for able-bodied people and I probably should’ve lowered my expectations. I think this also has to do with web developers’ reliance on some semi-automated tools that produce HTML code which casually and frequently breaks ARIA specifications. The topic of web accessibility with regards to art galleries is intriguing in that I’m not entirely sure how this is pertinent(compared to the overall issues all over the internet); maybe it’s their tendency to design their websites in a less-functional and more aesthetic driven manner?</p>
                    <p>As to the New York City subway, I had a somewhat related experience that further strengthened my belief in universal design, similar to the curb-cut example: once I attempted to travel to JFK with two big suitcases(admitted filled with too much junk and the airline was definitely happy to charge me a ridiculous amount) and I think we all know how it went. That time I also felt the struggle of Sasha Blair-Goldensohn and had to pray for working elevators and fortunately did make it on time. And as I started to pay attention to accessibility issues with public transport, I noticed a interesting discrepancy as I travelled back and forth between the states and China. In my hometown Nanjing, the subway system is about one third the size of NYC in terms of station count and roughly on par in daily ridership, and I couldn’t help notice the surprising abundance of elevators, ramps, and some kind of mini elevator that attaches to the stair handrails which could move a person on a wheelchair along said rails, which stands in stark contrast of the overall inferior accessible infrastructure in China, and the honestly weird absence of people with disabilities on the streets and using these facilities in general(likely due to the overall unfriendliness of society and most street infrastructure)</p>
                    <p>On a totally unrelated note, as the credits rolled and “Like a ship” by Pastor T.L. Barrett played along, I instantly recognized that it sounds exactly like, I couldn’t identify which, but something I’ve been listening to recently; and it turns out it’s The Knocks’ <em>All About You</em> featuring Foster the People that sampled this song so yeah there’s that, a happy coincidence.</p>

                    <p>The reading had a heavy emphasis on the sense of community and its power. As I read about Lateef McLeod’s struggles in <em>Gaining Power through Communication Access</em>, I got curiously intrigued in this <em>Touch Talker</em> device and one Google search later boy was I not disappointed. </p>
                    <p><a href="./images/2.jpg"><img src="./images/2.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="img"></a></p>
                    <p>I was expecting a slightly modified keyboard but still, the clutter, overlapping letters and icons, the, ......, everything is beyond my imagination. </p>
                    <p>From my somehow above average knowledge on keyboards, I believe the overall layout that the keys aren’t staggered is called ortholinear and is preferred by some touch typers since it requires less finger movement and is more efficient. However I’m not sure why it’s implemented here as it is quite different from the usual keyboard layout and might have implications with the users’ adapting to those.</p>
                    <p>Although I might not be in a position to say this, but still, with McLeod presenting the Touch Talker as a example of a bad AAC device, I couldn’t help but wonder if the person(s) who designed this monstrosity had consulted any person with these communication needs and even regular keyboard users. With this in mind, along with Alice Wong’s words that “[device like this] ... is usually not only, ..., very expensive but it’s often very ugly and not the easiest to use,” I had to wonder if there is a way for these devices to be sexy as we have come accustomed to with the usual consumer electronic devices. Would having disabled people being the designers help? I think yes but the usual tools, be it digital or physical, all seem woefully unoptimized in terms of accessibility even more than regular/consumer items and services, and that might be one of the many barriers for people with disabilities to design devices by themselves and for themselves.</p>

                    <h2>Temperament of design</h2>
                </div>        
                <div class="content-body">
                    <p>Having gone through our virtual field trip and read parts of Design Meets Disability I’m finding myself a bit perplexed and perhaps baffled over design practices in general and that might have something to do with my existing preferences and superstitions.</p>
                    <p>I was quite surprised when I came to the knowledge that people at ADA make virtually everything, namely numerous variations of a chair, in mostly just cardboard. I wasn’t sure why they weren’t made in a “cooler” way, given that we have a incredible range of digital manufacturing methods that are more accessible and affordable than ever, which I am a huge fan of. After realizing the practical needs of these chairs it all began to made sense: cardboard is easily replaceable, recyclable, repairable, and adjustable to the ever changing needs of one particular individual, which suits the one-on-one style of design at ADA particularly well. Although my brain still couldn’t help imagining those chairs but made with laser-cut aluminum sheets with countersink screw holes and 3D printed parts, I’m starting to get the idea and definitely appreciate the level of personality and creativity that they put into these cardboard chairs that my hypothetical version would definitely lack.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, I’m still trying to contemplate the role of different manufacturing methods in assistive design. With the example of the Tissot Silen-T watch presented in Identity Meets Ability, I find it quite attractive as a piece of universal design that started out with visually impaired people in mind, and ended up as a device with the “usual” exquisiteness one tends to associate with these upmarket watches along with the accessibility feature. However with a watch like this, I find it a bit of an edge case since, despite it not being ridiculously expensive like some watches do, the Tissot Silen-T is still kind of a luxury item for many. With the  economy of scale more in play with more commodity items, I’m wondering whether it would affect implementation of these features positively of negatively.</p>
                    <p>There’s also quite fascinating bit of detail that I find similar to the iOS color filter feature I discovered last class that could be useful in a darkroom environment. In <em>tuning in; tuning out</em>, it’s presented that a capital D-eaf individual finds the hearing aid valuable in its adjustable sensitivity that allows him to adjust from “nonhearing to superhuman”. It is strikingly similar to Aimee Mullen’s numerous legs that fulfill athletic and aesthetic purposes, and even allow her to grow inches taller, perhaps reaching the realm of augmentation with things that are traditionally classified as restoration. The idea of a variable level of hearing sensitivity is also now commonplace as virtually every noise cancelling headphones/earbuds now provide a number of modes between transparency(admittedly not as extreme as eavesdropping) and noise cancellation(again not quite like deaf yet but we’re getting close).</p>

                <div class="content-body">
                    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                    <p>The discussion on the so-called “inspiration” with people with disabilities by Stella Young and the NYT article on Paralympic athletes was thought-provoking(but definitely not inspirational) to me, and got me thinking: what do we really mean when we read an “inspirational” story and say stuff along the lines of, “wow this is so inspiring?”</p>
                    <p>To begin, I’d like to present a alternative, but maybe somewhat similar scenario where we might utter similar remarks. It perhaps isn&#39;t a rare occurrence that we heard about all the success stories of “self-made” billionaires and their stories of journeys of arduous overcoming of the most substantial obstacles, and the reassurance that hard-working, with the utmost earnest, will lead to success akin to theirs. And stories like these are often fabricated, be it from the protagonist themselves or the dedicated and talented wonderful people from some world-renowned PR firm that specializes in white-washing questionable business practices.</p>
                    <p>And hereby we might read these stories and say the damned word: &quot;inspiring.&quot; But what is exactly inspiring here? What is inspiring about the age-old truth of “hard work pays off” other than the grossly blown out proportions of, apparently, how “hard-work” can reasonably lead to multiple billion dollars, undisputedly through a singular person&#39;s effort, and definitely without their dad&#39;s considerable accumulated wealth. I think the inspiration in play here, is what I’d call a <strong>false hope</strong>, or as some might refer to as the, <em>cough</em> American dream <em>cough</em>. The grand outcome isn’t replicable, or even remotely achievable for the audience, and serves the sole purpose of the faint, fictious light, at the end of the dark tunnel that everyone of us might go through at some point. The inspiring thing here is the elusive promise of a cause-and-effect too good to be true.</p>
                    <p>And I digress. It might be a similar case with stories of disabled people. As Young puts it, there is very little that’s genuine about the “inspired-ness” and the usual response on the inside of readers is often: “Well, however bad my life is, it could be worse. I could be that person.” Here the story is, arguably, less often fabricated by some kind of agent but rather by ourselves as the readers or viewers. I find myself constantly picturing the life without a certain limb whenever I encounter stories of people with such disabilities and all that comes up are the ginormous difficulties in carrying out tasks that I take the ability to do so for granted. Never have I considered the agency of the person in these stories, and they have been merely reduced to the imaginary subject of a story as simple as “overcoming difficulties”, that has the prospect of arriving upon me one day. In these imaginary scenarios(or inspiration porn), we go on the fantastical trips of being in others shoes for the sake of making ourselves “feel good” and sometimes “grateful” for not being like them, sort of opposite to the previous example where we’re supposed to feel bad and start working harder.</p>
                    <h3>Big bad world</h3>
                    <p>Here comes the question: why do we feel good about not being in their situation, as in disabled? </p>
                    <p>Again I present a wildly unrelated example, of a bipedal, humanoid fictious alien, with three arms, two of which in the “ordinary” position and one sticking straight out the chest(the design is probably a result of limitations of 90s computer graphics and maybe the designer’s imagination but anyway). It might not be readily apparent where the “third” arm is in the picture below so here’s <a href='https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/Vortigaunt'>some context</a>.</p>
                    <p><a href="images/vortigaunt.jpg"><img src="images/vortigaunt.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="image-of-vortigaunts"></a></p>
                    <p>These creatures, called Vortigaunts, arrived on Earth after some scientist dude messed up the space-time continuum. And let’s now imagine a “disabled” Vortigaunt, without the central arm on the chest, fighting along our beloved protagonist against the bad guys. Are they still considered disabled, if they can still operate everything their human colleagues could and be fully capable of realizing their objectives? (except with fewer fingers but let’s not go that far)</p>
                    <p>I think this plays into the topic of how the concept of disability is shaped by the inadaptiveness of our world and society, as an abnormality and something that requires special attention. And this brings us to another remotely relevant topic, transhumanism. Maybe one day, not having (access to) biomechatronic enhancements would be considered “disabled” in a world where these technologies are the accepted norm. And it’s not really a reality far off from the world we live in. With the (arguably over) reliance on mobile devices and related technologies(especially in China, it’s really bad), being technologically-illiterate(be it willingly or not) could might as well be considered a disability, and I’ve definitely observed examples of people actually accepting this view(in a derogatory way), given said abilities are widely considered fundamental for someone to effectively function in the society.</p>
