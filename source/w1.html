<title>&quot;w1 - Same old mistake&quot;</title></head>
<body>
<p>I really enjoyed the podcast even though I do have problems with some parts of it. </p>
<p>The part involving the three-mile island incident and how feedback matters are both really intriguing ways to think about user-centric design. The latter made me think about my decision to purchase an Apple Watch recently to help with my pandemic-stricken lifestyle that has gotten increasingly sedentary. And it did help massively; the activity rings are an amazing means of feedback that encourages a more active lifestyle. In fact, the entire Activity/Fitness part of the Apple Watch is almost entirely comprised of different types of feedback to get the user up and moving more. Apart from the activity ring, there are awards, notifications, and competition with &quot;watch buddies&quot;, that make the shift towards a more active lifestyle rather fun, and arguably somewhat addictive. There could definitely be negative connotations to a system that creates an addictive feedback loop, but in this instance, for what its worth, it works well and doesn&#39;t necessarily have a &quot;malicious&quot; intent to it.</p>
<p>I think the most interesting part, and the part that I have most problems with(not necessarily a bad thing), is where the host and guests discuss planned obsolescence, or rather the fact that new and &quot;better&quot; products come out every year. There is a factual error in that they claim that iPhones are thinner every year when, in reality, they have gotten thicker from 2014 to 2019 with every major design revision. With that said, the question of, how is the new iPhone better, still applies. When I swapped out my totally smashed iPhone X from 2017 for a shiny new iPhone 12 Pro last year, my first impressions were, as expected, somehow underwhelming. The &quot;new&quot; boxy design(even though it is similar to iPhone 4 and 5s from the early 2010s) feels much worse in the hand. When I think about how a product get &quot;better&quot; iteratively every year, I could categorize changes into two types: design changes and technological advancements; and both types are subject to luring customers into the fallacy of &quot;new&quot;(and subsequently more advanced) is better. I would actually argue that Apple is pretty innocent in this aspect, and hereby I present my arch nemesis in mobile devices, and a example of (arguably) successfully selling a anti-user design in the name of it&#39;s &quot;new&quot;: curved screens. Look at almost every Samsung smartphone from the past 5 years or so and they all have screens curved outwards on both sides, but why? The curved display only came to fruition with the development of OLED displays that are flexible, and yet it doesn&#39;t improve the experience of the user in any meaningful way. In fact, far from it. Curved screens make swiping harder, creates distortion on the edges, are more prone to shattering, and ultimately, are more expensive which the customer is going to pay. This is something that I really don&#39;t understand over the years of following consumer electronics.</p>
