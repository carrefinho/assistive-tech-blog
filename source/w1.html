<body><h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>The discussion on the so-called “inspiration” with people with disabilities by Stella Young and the NYT article on Paralympic athletes was thought-provoking(but definitely not inspirational) to me, and got me thinking: what do we really mean when we read an “inspirational” story and say stuff along the lines of, “wow this is so inspiring?”</p>
<p>To begin, I’d like to present a alternative, but maybe somewhat similar scenario where we might utter similar remarks. It perhaps isn&#39;t a rare occurrence that we heard about all the success stories of “self-made” billionaires and their stories of journeys of arduous overcoming of the most substantial obstacles, and the reassurance that hard-working, with the utmost earnest, will lead to success akin to theirs. And stories like these are often fabricated, be it from the protagonist themselves or the dedicated and talented wonderful people from some world-renowned PR firm that specializes in white-washing questionable business practices.</p>
<p>And hereby we might read these stories and say the damned word: &quot;inspiring.&quot; But what is exactly inspiring here? What is inspiring about the age-old truth of “hard work pays off” other than the grossly blown out proportions of, apparently, how “hard-work” can reasonably lead to multiple billion dollars, undisputedly through a singular person&#39;s effort, and definitely without their dad&#39;s considerable accumulated wealth. I think the inspiration in play here, is what I’d call a <strong>false hope</strong>, or as some might refer to as the, <em>cough</em> American dream <em>cough</em>. The grand outcome isn’t replicable, or even remotely achievable for the audience, and serves the sole purpose of the faint, fictious light, at the end of the dark tunnel that everyone of us might go through at some point. The inspiring thing here is the elusive promise of a cause-and-effect too good to be true.</p>
<p>And I digress. It might be a similar case with stories of disabled people. As Young puts it, there is very little that’s genuine about the “inspired-ness” and the usual response on the inside of readers is often: “Well, however bad my life is, it could be worse. I could be that person.” Here the story is, arguably, less often fabricated by some kind of agent but rather by ourselves as the readers or viewers. I find myself constantly picturing the life without a certain limb whenever I encounter stories of people with such disabilities and all that comes up are the ginormous difficulties in carrying out tasks that I take the ability to do so for granted. Never have I considered the agency of the person in these stories, and they have been merely reduced to the imaginary subject of a story as simple as “overcoming difficulties”, that has the prospect of arriving upon me one day. In these imaginary scenarios(or inspiration porn), we go on the fantastical trips of being in others shoes for the sake of making ourselves “feel good” and sometimes “grateful” for not being like them, sort of opposite to the previous example where we’re supposed to feel bad and start working harder.</p>
<h3>Big bad world</h3>
<p>Here comes the question: why do we feel good about not being in their situation, as in disabled? </p>
<p>Again I present a wildly unrelated example, of a bipedal, humanoid fictious alien, with three arms, two of which in the “ordinary” position and one sticking straight out the chest(the design is probably a result of limitations of 90s computer graphics and maybe the designer’s imagination but anyway). It might not be readily apparent where the “third” arm is in the picture below so here’s <a href='https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/Vortigaunt'>some context</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../images/iu" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="img"></p>
<p>These creatures, called Vortigaunts, arrived on Earth after some scientist dude messed up the space-time continuum. And let’s now imagine a “disabled” Vortigaunt, without the central arm on the chest, fighting along our beloved protagonist against the bad guys. Are they still considered disabled, if they can still operate everything their human colleagues could and be fully capable of realizing their objectives? (except with fewer fingers but let’s not go that far)</p>
<p>I think this plays into the topic of how the concept of disability is shaped by the inadaptiveness of our world and society, as an abnormality and something that requires special attention. And this brings us to another remotely relevant topic, transhumanism. Maybe one day, not having (access to) biomechatronic enhancements would be considered “disabled” in a world where these technologies are the accepted norm. And it’s not really a reality far off from the world we live in. With the (arguably over) reliance on mobile devices and related technologies(especially in China, it’s really bad), being technologically-illiterate(be it willingly or not) could might as well be considered a disability, and I’ve definitely observed examples of people actually accepting this view(in a derogatory way), given said abilities are widely considered fundamental for someone to effectively function in the society.</p>
