<h3>Just Enough Research by Erika Hall</h3>
<p>I have to say I went into the talk with a bit ambivalence, given my reluctance to conduct any kind of research in almost everything I do and the frustrating inability to change that(while also somehow taking pride in that), but it was quite refreshing see a few new perspectives on the topic of research. Admittedly, Erika Hall&#39;s dressing for the job you want approach and sometimes whacky slides did help the presentation but I digress.</p>
<p>The Segway example is really compelling as something that was built upon a distorted premise. Apparently Segway, as in the two-wheeled self-balancing vehicle, had been discontinued by June 2020. Erika Hall talked about how the Segway only manages to cater to a very limited demographic and yet claims to change the world of personal transportation, and this got me thinking, was the premise of Segway really to change the world or just a buzzword for attracting money from investors and governments(who apparently have legitimate use cases)? One explanation I have is that, the people behind the project had become so firmly entrenched in the genuinely advanced technology that they&#39;d lost touch to a point where they perceived a $6,000 gadget could be the future. In that aspect I do agree with Hall&#39;s point but I&#39;m still not entirely sure.</p>
<p>On a broader level, one aspect that I found particularly helpful is the effect of research in the context of teamwork. Retrospectively, this could&#39;ve saved me(and my teammate) a lot of confusion and back and forth over ideas that seemed difficult to convey and exchange. Asking questions, working together to understand those questions and highlighting the problem does seem like a wonderful way to set the record straight and highly beneficial for efficient cooperation.</p>
<h3>Talking to Humans - The Story</h3>
<p>Not sure about how I should be &quot;reviewing&quot; a story; with that said the story of Koshi and Roberta is a rather thorough breakdown of how two &quot;scientists&quot; began to do research on their customers. Admittedly, them going from &quot;I’m a scientist, not a salesperson.&quot; to actually being able to talk to people in the turn of a day seems a bit far fetched but I get it that some creative freedom was needed here.</p>
<p>Some of the key things that I find more unexpected and arguably counterintuitive: don&#39;t take any statistics too literally and let any single number dominate the strategic thinking. I find this quite intriguing as it is, at least for me, human nature for find meanings in numbers that I&#39;ve collected and firmly believe in them, and it is probably indeed detrimental to grasping the bigger picture in the context of studying customers where the sample size could be inherently limited.</p>
<p>Where the duo discovered the actual pattern of purchasing pillows is also quite interesting: they set out targeting new graduates who need to outfit their apartments but ended up finding out that pillow purchases tend to align with significant life changes later in their lives. When reading their initial pitch, I did look at my own pillow, which I took from home with me, and unsurprisingly wasn&#39;t bought by myself. In fact I have no idea that I have no idea how to buy a pillow and I guess it is impossible for me to realize that without the story outlining how Koshi and Roberta did their research on buying pillows.</p>
