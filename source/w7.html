<p>The article was quite an interesting read, as I haven&#39;t touched Tik Tok for quite some time after creating an account for some reason, and it does shed some light on how it hooks people. </p>
<p>I think the minimizing of friction is really something the developers&#39; have polished to an extreme extent, or in other words, shoving the &quot;content&quot; right into users&#39; faces(which I find extraordinarily annoying, especially when it takes over the music I have playing in the background whenever I open the app). The way content is displayed fits the content format perfectly(as in vertical video, a cardinal sin) where the device&#39;s display has no wasted space and they don&#39;t add any extra steps like having to manually start playing or unmuting. The infinite scroll isn&#39;t a new idea but, by displaying only one piece of the content, the &quot;surprise mechanic&quot; as mentioned in the article is really in play here(again I find it quite obnoxious, but that&#39;s probably due to me just not viewing much stuff and interacting so that the algorithm has no idea what I like so I ended up with a feed of just whatever is trending), which provokes the user&#39;s curiosity to keep on scrolling.   </p>
<p>I&#39;m quite torn on the idea of built in behavior management mechanisms built into these apps because, given that Tik Tok is pretty much built upon their method of delivering content(a large portion of which is of &quot;discover&quot; type) and changing that in any meaningful way would probably be detrimental to the overall experience, like say, the user scrolls upwards, and boom, there&#39;s nothing left. If the users could have access to their &quot;profile&quot; in the eye of the algorithm and make modifications should they desire, that would probably be effective in controlling the scope of content intake and thus limit the amount of infinite scrolling from happening, but again, giving users this level of access seems unlikely, and it&#39;ll still require some level of self control for it to be effective. A system level limitation on screen time, similar to what is already present with iOS, is, in my opinion, the simplest and most effective restrictive method, since there are no changes to the consumption process but a straightforward time limit.</p>
<p>Reflecting upon my daily routings, I probably spend too much time on YouTube, because I have a weird habit of listening to some vocal content when working. It&#39;s usually news podcasts, and, very frequently, a particular PC hardware YouTuber who rambles too much and makes videos of upwards of one hour about very simple subjects. These usually serve as background noise whenever I do stuff unrelated to text(in which case it gets distracting), housework or random errands, and I do still process the content in my brain albeit at a very surface level. Here some of the usual techniques still definitely apply; I usually stick with one YouTuber and binge their longer content pieces, as to who gets to be that lucky one is largely decided by whatever the algorithm decides to show on my home page on that day. And auto play doesn&#39;t help either. </p>
