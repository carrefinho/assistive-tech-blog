<p>I got hooked 10 seconds into the talk when Paul Bennett kindly provided the crucial trivia that the &quot;Hello&quot; was in Bauer Bodoni and instantly gratified the typographically hysterical part of my brain. Overall I quite enjoyed this talk, and, as usual, still had a couple of problems and points of confusion to share.</p>
<p>The first two parts where Paul addresses the &quot;bleeding obvious&quot; and &quot;finding yourself in the margins&quot; make great points and, in my opinion, are somewhat intervened. They both present ways to think about the relationship between the designer and the user and putting ourselves into their shoes. </p>
<p>At the same time, I&#39;m not so sure about the example of the children&#39;s storage solution for IKEA presented in the third part. On the surface it&#39;s a clear and cut example of, as the title of the chapter suggests, having a beginner&#39;s mind. But then I thought about it from another perspective: would this be useful to me when I was a kid, when I, in Bennett&#39;s words, lived on, under, and around things? And the answer is maybe. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of stuffed animals but still had a couple that I really liked. The way I stored them was placing them on top of the sofa in the living room, which was situated against the wall and created a little bench suitable for a row of toys to sit on. Now you might be wondering, how does a five-year-old easily reach on top of a sofa? The truth is, for some reason, at the time I used to climb on top of and jump between the sofas almost too much, thus I had no problems making my way up and this was a very customized solution. </p>
<p>I was also really into model cars; especially larger 1:18 scale ones made of metal, with openable doors, hood/bonnet, working steering rack and suspension, et cetera. And how did I store them? Well, being scarily aware of their fragility after breaking a couple of wing mirrors off(and my naïve heart multiple times), I eventually resorted to a very adult-ish solution: in my father&#39;s bookshelf, specifically the lower levels. He&#39;s not going to touch them, and I don&#39;t run the risk of accidentally bumping them off or anything like that.</p>
<p>At this point I&#39;ve probably went too far with my childhood memories, but the point is: I&#39;m not very fond of this particular solution because it seems to reduce the target demographic into one very specific stereotype. Not all children are the same; not all live under and around things(some also on top of things), and not every kid needs a commercialized storage solution for their stuffed toys. This design, to me, feels like only scratching the surface of the mentality of a child, and attempts not to augment their existing &quot;scheme&quot; of using the space around but simply provides a complete answer to the problem(if there is one to begin with). It in a way contradicts with the previous chapter in that I think children should be encouraged to come up with their own solutions of storage, which could probably also be seen from a development perspective but that&#39;s story for another day. </p>
<p>Of course it&#39;s not meant for every kid, as in not any bookshelf is for everyone, but still, I&#39;m just not a fan of this design. Out of curiosity, I looked up &quot;IKEA children storage&quot; on Google, and the results are as follows.</p>

<p>Apparently kids don&#39;t really mind shelves and bins.</p>
