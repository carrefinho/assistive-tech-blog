<body><h1>Temperament of design</h1>
<p>Having gone through our virtual field trip and read parts of Design Meets Disability I’m finding myself a bit perplexed and perhaps baffled over design practices in general and that might have something to do with my existing preferences and superstitions.</p>
<p>I was quite surprised when I came to the knowledge that people at ADA make virtually everything, namely numerous variations of a chair, in mostly just cardboard. I wasn’t sure why they weren’t made in a “cooler” way, given that we have a incredible range of digital manufacturing methods that are more accessible and affordable than ever, which I am a huge fan of. After realizing the practical needs of these chairs it all began to made sense: cardboard is easily replaceable, recyclable, repairable, and adjustable to the ever changing needs of one particular individual, which suits the one-on-one style of design at ADA particularly well. Although my brain still couldn’t help imagining those chairs but made with laser-cut aluminum sheets with countersink screw holes and 3D printed parts, I’m starting to get the idea and definitely appreciate the level of personality and creativity that they put into these cardboard chairs that my hypothetical version would definitely lack.</p>
<p>At the same time, I’m still trying to contemplate the role of different manufacturing methods in assistive design. With the example of the Tissot Silen-T watch presented in Identity Meets Ability, I find it quite attractive as a piece of universal design that started out with visually impaired people in mind, and ended up as a device with the “usual” exquisiteness one tends to associate with these upmarket watches along with the accessibility feature. However with a watch like this, I find it a bit of an edge case since, despite it not being ridiculously expensive like some watches do, the Tissot Silen-T is still kind of a luxury item for many. With the  economy of scale more in play with more commodity items, I’m wondering whether it would affect implementation of these features positively of negatively.</p>
<p>There’s also quite fascinating bit of detail that I find similar to the iOS color filter feature I discovered last class that could be useful in a darkroom environment. In <em>tuning in; tuning out</em>, it’s presented that a capital D-eaf individual finds the hearing aid valuable in its adjustable sensitivity that allows him to adjust from “nonhearing to superhuman”. It is strikingly similar to Aimee Mullen’s numerous legs that fulfill athletic and aesthetic purposes, and even allow her to grow inches taller, perhaps reaching the realm of augmentation with things that are traditionally classified as restoration. The idea of a variable level of hearing sensitivity is also now commonplace as virtually every noise cancelling headphones/earbuds now provide a number of modes between transparency(admittedly not as extreme as eavesdropping) and noise cancellation(again not quite like deaf yet but we’re getting close).</p>
