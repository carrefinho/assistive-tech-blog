<p>The article outlined a couple of interesting things in Spotify&#39;s process of designing their personas and quite effectively presented the reason behind their need for said personas given that Spotify is a product with, understandably, extremely diverse user groups and personalized features that demand a level of understanding of such users.</p>
<p>The &quot;failed&quot; Phase 1 from 2017 is rather intriguing in that, contrary to my instincts, they found that the actual behaviors(as in attitude, value judgement, and usage of devices) are more effective as the incentive for listening to music is consistent across users. This does make sense upon further consideration, but since they didn&#39;t really disclose much detail in the reasoning process, I can&#39;t really figure out much more either. But I do believe their approach is effective in their attention on users&#39; usage of devices, which presumably resulted in the Spotify Connect feature. This concept of Spotify Connect is quite simple, to allow devices to control each other&#39;s playback, but it does provide a ton of convenience in the modern day where almost everything can run Spotify and the abundance of smart speakers in homes.</p>
<p>As to Phase 2, I was beginning to get a little confused when they started bringing up corporate jargon like <strong>Listening Together Framework™</strong>, and, to my great disappointment, not actually sharing anything about the personas aside from the illustrations. I do agree with the usage of color and illustrations to represent these fictional users(and user groups they belong to) in that I too find usage of stock photos or photos of random people in personas oddly disturbing. The crafted personality and behavior, in combination with the photograph, creates an eerily disturbing mixture of reality and &quot;engineered&quot; fiction.</p>
