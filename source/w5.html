<title>&quot;w5 - next billion ads&quot;</title></head>
<body>
<p>Again (almost as usual at this point), I&#39;m having really ambivalent feelings towards this &quot;Next Billion Users&quot; thing at Google. I&#39;m going to sound really cynical...... Please bear with me.</p>
<p>I understand and agree with most of the points that Asif Baki brought up. In particular, I have no doubts that with a company the size and scope of Google, such an initiative to broaden their focus and provide more relevant and accessible service to more parts of the world, would definitely help in the distribution of information as he stated. He brought up Google Files, an exemplar of the project. I looked it up and it is apparently very popular indeed on the Google Play Store. </p>
<p>However, as I went through the feature list of the Files app, I was suddenly and painfully reminded of my experience as an Android smartphone user from years past. Google Files is not new, at all. Apps like this(usually branded as system cleaning/performance-enhancing) have existed since practically the birth of the Android operating system. Android&#39;s open approach to file management, loose control over permissions, and unregulated app installations lead to significant performance degradation over short periods of usage, especially on lower-end devices, where the limited storage and memory only added fuel to the flame. Even though Google Files isn&#39;t a particularly new concept in itself, I can at least appreciate the effort, clean interface, not bundling malware(like its counterparts usually do; Files is debatable) and have some faith in Google&#39;s knowledge in their own operating system. But still, why can&#39;t they fix Android in the first place?</p>
<p>Google is pretty notorious for its <a href='https://killedbygoogle.com/'>infamous graveyard of killed projects</a>. I assume that, with the sheer size of their operations, teams are pretty much throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks(most don&#39;t), and apparently upper management is quite fond of this scraping-stuff-off-the-wall game. With this in mind, I actually feel like Next Billion Users could be helpful in that regard for them to tidy up their product development process(and maybe actually do research before releasing stuff).</p>
<p>At the same time, my trust issues with Google still surround me as I listened to the podcast. Google&#39;s main source of revenue is advertisement; and the next billion users are the next billion potential customers(or as some might prefer to put it: the products). The most privacy-conscious are trying everything to remove Google from their lives, and yet we seem to have no option but relying this much on mega-corporations to push the access of internet and information in less-developed regions. The privacy issues of Google and co have long been comprehensively documented, and yet, even among those relatively tech-literate(like us), we either have no option but to willfully neglect the risks or are simply not aware of them. Let alone those who maybe just gotten their hands on their first smartphone: the invasion of privacy will surely be swept under the radar. There is no substantial opposing force against targeted advertising(except maybe GDPR), and there won&#39;t be one either among the next billion users.</p>
<p>This is where, I&#39;m again reminded of what I&#39;ve been thinking about since the beginning of the class: how often is product and UX design, in these contexts, set up to &quot;educate&quot; the user rather than being designed around them? I&#39;m clearly aware of the manipulative and addiction inducing mechanics all over the internet, and there are indubitably people behind them. It&#39;s just that we&#39;ll probably never get to know what happened behind the curtains, behind the sunshine and rainbow of how they&#39;re addressing &quot;the needs of people living in rapidly growing global communities&quot;.</p>
<p>This podcast definitely reminded me of one thing though: I&#39;ve been holding off getting rid of Google Chrome for too long. I made the move to <a href='https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium'>ungoogled-chromium</a> before writing this and, well, it&#39;s not bad for now.</p>
<blockquote><p>I just realized I borked my Github pages that the post from last week wasn&#39;t up; it should be here now.</p>
